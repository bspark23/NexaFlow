# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing weather app by adding AI-powered productivity features and Kiro hooks that provide intelligent notifications, travel planning assistance, calendar integration, and educational capabilities. The enhancements will work alongside the current weather display without altering the core UI, providing users with proactive weather-based insights and automations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Travel Planner Hook

**User Story:** As a user searching for weather in different cities, I want to receive intelligent packing tips when extreme weather is detected, so that I can prepare appropriately for my travels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for a city THEN the system SHALL check the forecast for rain or extreme weather conditions
2. IF rain or extreme weather is detected THEN the system SHALL generate contextual packing tips
3. WHEN packing tips are generated THEN the system SHALL display them as side notifications without altering the main weather display
4. WHEN rain is detected for tomorrow THEN the system SHALL show a message like "It will rain tomorrow in Lagos, don't forget an umbrella"
5. WHEN extreme weather conditions are found THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate preparation advice

### Requirement 2: AI Alerts & Automations Hook

**User Story:** As a user who wants to stay informed about weather changes, I want to receive automated alerts when rain, storms, or heat waves are expected soon, so that I can adjust my schedule accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs hourly background checks THEN it SHALL fetch current weather API data
2. IF rain, storms, or heat waves are predicted within the next 6 hours THEN the system SHALL trigger a push notification
3. WHEN a weather alert is triggered THEN the notification SHALL include messages like "Weather alert: rain expected soon, adjust your schedule"
4. WHEN no severe weather is detected THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring without sending notifications
5. WHEN the hook runs THEN it SHALL not interfere with the main application performance

### Requirement 3: Calendar Integration Hook

**User Story:** As a user who schedules outdoor events, I want the system to check weather forecasts for my outdoor events and suggest rescheduling if bad weather is predicted, so that I can avoid weather-related disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds an event marked as 'outdoor' to Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL check the forecast for that event date
2. IF bad weather is predicted for the event date THEN the system SHALL suggest rescheduling the event
3. WHEN rescheduling is suggested THEN the system SHALL send a notification with the recommendation
4. WHEN the weather is favorable THEN the system SHALL not send any notifications
5. WHEN calendar integration is active THEN it SHALL only monitor events explicitly marked as 'outdoor'

### Requirement 4: Morning Brief Hook

**User Story:** As a user who wants to start my day informed about weather conditions, I want to receive a daily morning brief with today's forecast and recommendations, so that I can plan my day effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs daily at 7:00 AM THEN it SHALL fetch today's weather forecast
2. WHEN the forecast is retrieved THEN the system SHALL generate a personalized morning message
3. WHEN generating the message THEN it SHALL include temperature, weather conditions, and timing of significant weather events
4. WHEN the message is ready THEN it SHALL be sent as a notification without modifying the main weather display
5. WHEN creating recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide actionable advice like "carry an umbrella" or "wear sunscreen"

### Requirement 5: Educational AI Tutor (Optional)

**User Story:** As a user curious about weather phenomena, I want to ask questions about weather concepts and receive simple explanations, so that I can better understand meteorological processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Learn About Weather" button THEN the system SHALL open a chat interface
2. WHEN the user asks weather-related questions THEN the AI SHALL provide conversational, educational responses
3. WHEN responding to questions THEN the AI SHALL use simple language appropriate for general audiences
4. WHEN the chat mode is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with the main weather functionality
5. WHEN users ask about concepts like humidity or seasonal patterns THEN the system SHALL provide accurate, helpful explanations

### Requirement 6: API Caching Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user making repeated weather requests, I want faster response times for recently queried locations, so that the app feels more responsive and reduces unnecessary API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes API calls THEN it SHALL implement caching for weather data
2. WHEN a location is requested again within the cache period THEN the system SHALL serve cached data instead of making new API calls
3. WHEN serving cached data THEN the response time SHALL be significantly faster than API calls
4. WHEN implementing caching THEN the existing response handling and UI SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch fresh data from the API

### Requirement 7: Mood-Based Weather Playlist

**User Story:** As a user who enjoys music that matches the weather, I want to receive playlist suggestions based on current weather conditions, so that I can enhance my mood with appropriate music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weather data is available THEN the system SHALL analyze weather conditions for mood matching
2. WHEN sunny weather is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest "Happy Vibes Playlist"
3. WHEN rainy weather is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest "Chill Mood Playlist"
4. WHEN the playlist is ready THEN it SHALL be displayed as an optional widget below the forecast
5. WHEN integrating with music services THEN it SHALL support Spotify and YouTube APIs

### Requirement 8: Disaster Alert Hook

**User Story:** As a user in areas prone to extreme weather, I want to receive emergency alerts for severe weather warnings with safety tips, so that I can take appropriate precautions to stay safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects extreme weather warnings THEN it SHALL check for storms, floods, and heatwaves
2. WHEN severe weather is detected THEN the system SHALL send an emergency alert notification
3. WHEN sending emergency alerts THEN the system SHALL include relevant safety tips
4. WHEN no extreme weather is present THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring without alerts
5. WHEN emergency alerts are sent THEN they SHALL have higher priority than regular notifications

### Requirement 9: Kiro Integration and File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want all generated specs, hooks, and steering files to be organized in the .kiro folder, so that it's clear this work was done by Kiro and properly structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating project artifacts THEN all specs SHALL be saved in .kiro/specs directory
2. WHEN generating hooks THEN they SHALL be saved in .kiro/hooks directory  
3. WHEN creating steering files THEN they SHALL be saved in .kiro/steering directory
4. WHEN organizing files THEN the structure SHALL be clear and maintainable
