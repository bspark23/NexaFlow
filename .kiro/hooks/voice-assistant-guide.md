## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Speaking Tips
1. **Speak clearly** and at normal pace
2. **Use natural language** - the system understands conversational commands
3. **Wait for the listening indicator** before speaking
4. **Speak within 10 seconds** - the system auto-stops after timeout

### Command Examples
- ‚úÖ Good: "weather in Tokyo"
- ‚úÖ Good: "show me analytics"
- ‚úÖ Good: "switch to dark mode"
- ‚ùå Avoid: "weather Tokyo" (missing connecting words)
- ‚ùå Avoid: Speaking too fast or mumbling

## üß™ Testing & Development

### Demo Mode (localhost only)
When running on localhost, you'll see additional demo buttons:

### Manual Testing
You can test commands without speaking by using the browser console:
```javascript
// Get the voice assistant instance
const voice = window.nexaflowVoice;

// Test a command
voice.testCommand("weather in Paris");
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No data storage**: Voice commands are processed in real-time and not stored
